Many tabletop games use dice for various game mechanics. Dice come in many shapes and sizes, commonly having 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20 sides. Many games require you to gather a set of dice of different sizes and roll them together. Create a program that simulates dice for a tabletop game.

Create a class representing a single die. The constructor should accept an integer indicating how many sides the die has. The class should have a function to simulate rolling the die, returning a random number within the valid range.
Create a class representing a pool of dice. This class should have functions to add or remove a die from the pool. The class should also have a function to roll all the dice in the pool and return the total that was rolled.
